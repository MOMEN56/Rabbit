Hello guys! Today, I'm excited to release the first version of my app.

---

##  Project Overview

App name: Rabbit

This project is a Flutter-based **Internet Speed Test application** that allows users to measure their **download speed, upload speed, ping**, and view their **public IP address** with a smooth and modern UI.

The app focuses on real-time network status detection, clean architecture, and responsive animations to provide a polished user experience.

## ✨ Key Features

*  Real-time internet connection monitoring (Connected / No Access / Disconnected)
*  Animated start experience with Lottie
*  Live download & upload speed tracking
*  Accurate ping measurement
*  Public IP detection
*  Smart test cancellation & timeout handling

## 🧱 Technical Stack & Architecture

### **Framework & Language**

* Flutter (Dart)

### **State Management**

* `flutter_bloc` (Cubit-based architecture)

### **Architecture Pattern**

* Feature-based clean architecture
* Separation of concerns:

  * Presentation layer (UI)
  * State management layer (Cubits & States)
  * Core utilities & shared components

### **Networking & Utilities**

* Internet connectivity & availability detection
* Speed testing & ping measurement

## 📦 Packages Used & Their Purpose

### **State Management**

* **flutter_bloc** → Handles business logic and UI state separation
* **equatable** → Simplifies state comparison

### **Networking & Internet**

* **connectivity_plus** → Detects network connectivity changes
* **internet_connection_checker_plus** → Verifies actual internet access
* **flutter_speed_test_plus** → Performs download & upload speed tests
* **dart_ping** → Measures network ping

### **UI & Animations**

* **lottie** → Smooth JSON-based animations
* **syncfusion_flutter_gauges** → Speedometer gauge visualization
* **flutter_screenutil** → Responsive UI across devices
* **google_fonts** → Custom typography

### **Device Features**

## 🧠 App Flow Summary

1. App starts with internet state monitoring
2. User presses start → animation plays
3. Speed test begins (download → upload)
4. Live results are displayed
5. User can cancel the test at any time
6. Final results are shown with smooth transitions

---

## 📌 Notes

* The app is designed to be easily scalable
* Each feature is isolated for maintainability
* Built with performance and UX in mind
